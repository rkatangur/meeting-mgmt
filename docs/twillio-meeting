Integration with Appointment in ephase:
1. Need to add a new field called meeting type which can be INPERSON or VIRTUAL
	a. When the meeting type is INPERSON, careSetting information is needed and is the user selects the meeting type as VIRTUAL careSetting will be null.

2. As part of Appointment creation create a zoom meeting and capture the information in a new column "appt_attributes" and store the information as a JSON.
	a. Add a column for this. Later we will move to seperate table if we see the data is complex.
